DESCRIPTION
--------------

Timefield is a Field API field that can store 3 types of time values: a simple
time value, a start time and end time, or a combination of these two with a 
basic weekly repeat value.  The values are stored in the database as integer 
offsets from 12AM.  If the second value continues into the next day, 
i.e. 8PM - 2AM, the second value is stored as an offset +1 day.

The goal of this field is to provide time storage that is not dependent on the 
Gregorian calendar.

INSTALLATION
------------

1) Start by copying the module files into your 'modules' directory 
(usually /sites/all/modules)

2) The Timefield module works in conjunction with the Libraries module. If not
already installed, download, enable, and configure the latest versions of the
Libraries module.

3) Download jQZoom from 
http://fgelinas.com/code/timepicker/releases/jquery-ui-timepicker-0.2.9.zip
and unzip the archive into your site's 'libraries' directory (usually 
/site/all/libraries), specifically to the /timepicker directory.  If you have 
drush installed, you can use the command "drush dl timefield-plugin" to 
automatically download and install this library.

USAGE
-------
Timefield module provides a field type 'timefield' with a default JQuery widget.
The timefield can have an optional 'to time' and various input formats, 
depending on your preference.  While this field is multi-value capable, 
I am not really sure about a use-case for this.  
There are a three display formatters, time (with optional to time, duration,
and a mini-calendar output.  You can configure various output formats in the 
format settings dialog option on the "Manage Display" section of the Field API UI.
